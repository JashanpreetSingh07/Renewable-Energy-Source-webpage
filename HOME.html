        <span class="f">H</span>ow Solar Panels Work:
    </h4>
    <p>
        Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, work by converting sunlight into
         electricity through a process known as the photovoltaic effect. Here's how it works:
        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Photon Absorption:</b> When sunlight (photons) hits the solar panel's photovoltaic cells,
                 the photons are absorbed by the semiconductor material, usually silicon.</li>
            <li><b>Generation of Electron-Hole Pairs:</b> As the photons are absorbed, they energize electrons
                 in the semiconductor material, causing them to become "excited" and creating electron-hole pairs.</li>
            <li><b>Electric Current Generation:</b> The excited electrons move through the semiconductor, creating
                 an electric current. This flow of electrons is captured as direct current (DC) electricity.</li>
            <li><b>Inverter Conversion:</b> The DC electricity is then passed through an inverter, which converts
                 it into alternating current (AC) electricity, suitable for use in homes and businesses.</li>
            <li><b>Utility or Storage:</b> The AC electricity can be used to power electrical appliances in real-time,
                 stored in batteries for later use, or even fed back into the grid.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4><span class="f">H</span>ow Geothermal Energy Taps into the Earth's Natural Heat:</h4>
    <p>
        Geothermal energy harnesses heat from within the Earth's crust, which originates from the planet's
         formation and the radioactive decay of minerals. This heat is continually produced and provides an
          abundant and sustainable energy source. Here's how it's tapped:
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Heat Reservoirs:</b> Geothermal energy is most accessible in regions with volcanic activity,
             tectonic plate boundaries, and geothermal hotspots. Underground, there are natural reservoirs 
             of hot water and steam.</li>
        <li><b>Geothermal Wells:</b> Wells are drilled into these reservoirs to access the high-temperature 
            water and steam. The depth and temperature of the wells can vary based on the local geothermal conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Geothermal Power Plants:</b> The hot water or steam from the wells is used to turn turbines in 
            geothermal power plants, which, in turn, generate electricity. This process is similar to
             conventional power plants, but it relies on the Earth's heat instead of burning fossil fuels.</li>

    <h4><span class="f">G</span>eothermal Power Plants and Their Efficiency:</h4>
    <p>There are several types of geothermal power plants, including:
        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Dry Steam Power Plants:</b> These plants use high-temperature steam directly from the Earth's
                 reservoirs to turn turbines, making them highly efficient.</li>
            <li><b>Flash Steam Power Plants:</b> Hot water from the reservoir is released into a low-pressure tank,
                 causing it to "flash" into steam, which is used to generate electricity.</li>
            <li><b>Binary Cycle Power Plants:</b> These plants transfer heat from the geothermal fluid to a secondary
                 fluid with a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid vaporizes and drives a turbine.</li>
        </ol>
        Geothermal power plants are known for their high efficiency and capacity factor (the percentage
         of time a plant generates power). Dry steam and flash steam power plants typically have the highest
          efficiency levels, with capacity factors often exceeding 90%.

    <h4><span class="f">G</span>eothermal Energy's Sustainability and Minimal Environmental Impact:</h4>
    <p>Geothermal energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source for several reasons:
        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Renewable and Reliable:</b> The Earth's heat is essentially inexhaustible, making geothermal 
                energy a long-term and sustainable resource.</li>
            <li><b>Low Emissions:</b> Geothermal power plants release minimal greenhouse gases and pollutants,
                 contributing to cleaner air and reduced climate impact.</li>
            <li><b>Steady Power Supply:</b> Geothermal energy is available 24/7, providing consistent and 
                reliable power, unlike some other renewable sources that depend on weather conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Minimal Land Use:</b> Geothermal power plants require relatively small land areas, reducing 
                the environmental impact of large-scale energy production.</li>
